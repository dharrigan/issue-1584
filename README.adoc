= ISSUE-1584 (spring cloud stream)

NOTE: This is a stupid little project, it doesn't *do* anything, it's only
here to try and show the error.

== Environment

```
% uname -a
Linux anton 4.15.0-43-generic
```

```
% java --version <1>
java 11.0.1 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
```
<1> Although, this also fails with Java 8.

== Instructions

Change line `40` in `build.gradle.kts` to `val springCloudStreamVersion = "Fishtown.RELEASE"`
to show the error, or `val springCloudStreamVersion = "Fishtown.RC3"` to
show the test working.

* `./gradlew clean build`
